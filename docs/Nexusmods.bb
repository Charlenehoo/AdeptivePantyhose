AdeptivePantyhose

What it Does
AdeptivePantyhose is an SKSE plugin that dynamically adjusts your character's body based on the equipped footwear. By utilizing [b]BodySlide[/b] sliders created by Caenarvon, it works with the [b]RaceMenu[/b] interface (or its underlying [code]skee64.dll[/code]) to seamlessly morph your character's body. This eliminates any unsightly seams or clipping, ensuring your character's feet and toes are perfectly fitted to their pantyhose, especially when wearing high heels.
